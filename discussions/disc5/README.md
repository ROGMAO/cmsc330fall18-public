## Discussion 5

There is no graded discussion this week because there is a quiz. However, you
may want to try these exercises as a challenge. Try to implement all the
functions **without** defining any new functions (either named or anonymous).
There should be no `fun` in your file! Feel free to use `List.map` and the
`List.fold`s.
